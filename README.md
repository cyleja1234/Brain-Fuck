| \` | get input string by setting each charicter's asci code down the "graph".         |
| < | moves head/pointer left.                                                          |

| V | moves head/pointer down.                                                          |
| ^ | moves head/pointer up.                                                            |
| \[ | loops through the code untill the current head's/pointer's data is 0.            |
| ] | end of loop.                                                                      |
| - | subtract 1 from the curret head's/pointer's data, it is 0 then it will go to 255. |
| + | adds 1 to the curret head's/pointer's data, it is 255 then it will go to 0.       |

### Code examples

> ``` V`[.^]```

> this will get a string and print it back out, backwards!

<hr>

> ```V`^[^]V[.V]```

> this does the same thing but prints it normally!
